== Camel SSH Example

This example shows how to use Camel SSH component. The Main application will create an embedded SSH server (you can connect to a real one instead).

=== Run the Camel integration (producer)

You can run a producer by executing:

    mvn camel:run -Dexec.args="producer"

It will create a route that periodically SSH to the server and execute there a command.

=== Run the Camel integration (consumer)

You can run a consumer by executing:

    mvn camel:run -Dexec.args="consumer"

It will create a route that consume from calling a `date` command to an SSH session.
